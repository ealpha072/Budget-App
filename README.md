# Budget-App
This project was based on the 100 JS challenges. It is built with css, HTML and JS. More importantly, it was made to help familiarise with the vscode terminal and git navigation. All code was written locally and pushed remotely to this repository unlike previous projects.
## Things learnt;
   * Git commands- Git pull, git commit, git push, git rebase, git clone.
   * Vscode terminal navigation.
   * Opening vscode from the command line
