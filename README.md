# Budget-App
This project was based on the 100 JS challenges. It is built on css, HTML and JS. More importantly, it was made to help me familiarise with the vscode terminal and git navigation. All code was written locally and pushed remotely to this repository unlike previous projects.
## Things learnt;
   * Git commands.
   * Vscode terminal navigation.
